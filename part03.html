    <h1 class="big">FLAKES FILES - PART 03</h1>

    <section class="card">
      <div class="content" id="fileContent">

        <div class="title">The Robux Theft Era</div>
        <p>
          Everyone in SJC thought they already knew how messy Flakes was, but October and December proved they didn’t even know half of it.
          Flakes, also known as James, the 22-year-old almost-23 femboy menace of Donation Nation, wasn’t just manipulating people or hosting fake giveaways.
          He was running one of the biggest Robux theft operations the community had ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he did all of this under the same name: Flakes.<br>
          Like he wanted people to remember who scammed them.
        </p>

        <div class="title">Stealing Robux in Donation Nation</div>
        <p>
          James didn’t grind for anything. His entire Donation Nation “success” was built on tricking, lying, stealing, and manipulating anyone dumb enough to believe him.
        </p>

        <p>He used every scam possible:</p>
        <ul class="clean">
          <li>Pretending he would double players’ donations</li>
          <li>Acting like he was a mod inspecting booths</li>
          <li>Faking glitches to get access to someone’s stand</li>
          <li>Telling people he was sponsored by big creators</li>
          <li>Offering fake shoutouts for Robux</li>
          <li>Pretending he was running SJC “tax events”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          People saw him do it constantly.<br>
          Noom, Lexie, Zonez, Val, and CXI all witnessed him scam kids for hours straight.<br>
          Staroflight caught him telling some little kid he needed “temporary booth access” and then taking all the Robux and vanishing.<br>
          Seppgen said he once watched Flakes pretend to cry in voice chat so people would feel bad and donate.
        </p>
        <p>
          James didn’t even hide it well.<br>
          He just did it fast.
        </p>

        <div class="title">Using stolen funds to boost his stats</div>
        <p>
          One of the biggest jokes in the community was how James bragged about his raised and donated numbers like he actually earned them.
          But everyone found out the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was literally funneling stolen Robux into his own alts, then donating to himself to make it look like he was some elite top-tier player.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jens and Noah watched him switch between accounts so fast that he confused his own usernames.<br>
          Tripl3tsgamer said Flakes bragged about being in the “top donor circle” when all he did was steal from kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every number he flexed was fake.<br>
          Every donation he made was washed through alts.<br>
          Every “achievement” he showed off was bought with someone else’s money.
        </p>

        <div class="title">Stealing Christmas presents</div>
        <p>
          December was when people realized James wasn’t just a scammer. He was a villain in a Hallmark movie but without the character development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Players in SJC started losing their Christmas event gifts. Not currency. Actual special presents the staff spent time setting up.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then Ronaldo told everyone he heard James brag about “holiday hunting.”<br>
          Nobody knew what that meant until Leanne saw him pocketing Christmas gifts that were meant for new players.<br>
          Bugz literally called him the “Grinch of SJC,” and the name stuck instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          James didn’t only steal Robux.<br>
          He stole people’s Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who wakes up in the morning and says, “Yeah, I’m gonna ruin someone’s holiday today”?<br>
          James did.
        </p>

        <div class="title">Lying about everything</div>
        <p>
          By this point, the entire community understood that James couldn’t tell the truth to save his life. He lied about everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he said he had to go to work,<br>
          that meant he was stealing an account from some 10-year-old or convincing a kid to hand over a rare brainrot pet.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he said he was helping someone,<br>
          he was actually draining their booth or logging into one of his alts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he said he was tired,<br>
          that meant he ran out of people to scam for the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morse said James once forged fake screenshots to blame someone else for stealing from him, even though James was the one who did it.<br>
          Chloe caught him lying about his age, job, earnings, schedule, family, and even his favorite color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Half the things James said didn’t even make sense.<br>
          But he said them with confidence.
        </p>

        <div class="title">Begging rich players and using them</div>
        <p>
          James acted like he was this powerful donor, but almost all his Robux came from two sources:
        </p>
        <ol class="clean">
          <li>Offshore 15-year-olds farming Robux on PLS DONATE</li>
          <li>Rich players he begged nonstop</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The people he drained included:</p>
        <ul class="clean">
          <li>Haz3mn</li>
          <li>Zenuux</li>
          <li>Vrevix</li>
          <li>Sri</li>
          <li>Quinn</li>
          <li>Rox</li>
          <li>rrwxva</li>
          <li>PrinseElias</li>
          <li>Inviz</li>
          <li>Vexezifps</li>
          <li>Shlopiezz</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Every single one of them got used.<br>
          He didn’t talk to them because he liked them.<br>
          He talked to them because they had money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even Malb, who normally stays quiet, said James only messaged him when he wanted something.

        <div class="title">Extra chaotic things James did</div>
        <p>
          James’ scam list became so big the community basically collected his stories like Pokémon cards.
          Some things he did:
        </p>
        <ul class="clean">
          <li>Created alts to defend himself in arguments</li>
          <li>Made fake “official” SJC warnings to scare kids</li>
          <li>Pretended to be cousins with a Roblox dev</li>
          <li>Used a fake crying voice in VC to get sympathy</li>
          <li>Gaslit players by saying they donated to the wrong booth</li>
          <li>Sent AI-generated apology paragraphs and claimed he wrote them</li>
          <li>Told people his grandma “accidentally deleted his Robux”</li>
          <li>Said he was homeless while bragging about having 5 monitors</li>
          <li>Claimed SJC depended on him even though everyone was happier without him</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even Malb, Noom, Lexie, and Ronaldo agreed he was like a “walking red flag dressed in thigh highs.”
        </p>

        <div class="title">The collapse of his reputation</div>
        <p>
          By the time everything came out, James wasn’t just disliked.<br>
          He was infamous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone from Staroflight to Bugz had a Flakes horror story.<br>
          He became the biggest scammer Donation Nation had ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the worst part?<br>
          He still acted like he did nothing wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the SJC community remembered.<br>
          Every scam.<br>
          Every lie.<br>
          Every stolen Christmas present.<br>
          Every manipulative message.
        </p>
        <p>No amount of fake giveaways or uwu voices could hide who he really was.</p>
